 When your bunker started getting fired up
 You put a gun in your mouth and fired up!
 You dumb motherfucker, didn't Napoleon let you know?
 When you conquer Russia, better pack some fucking winter clothes!

 You needed stuff and I needed something a little different
 Say something, say anything, make a face, hold my hand
 Kiss my lips to show that you really is committed
 Four years is a lot of time, should we dismiss it?
 Forget it and live as if it never existed
 Emotions, I'm hopeless, it came to grow consistent
 Turned a friendship into love, but now that love is sort of distant
 I never thought I'd see the day I couldn't make you laugh
 Couldn't make you smile, couldn't even make you mad
 It's kind of like you're a cast or a mold
 Or something from the past that I used to have
 I'd do anything to get you back
 And you would do anything just to get me back
 I guess that's how it is
 They say it's better to have loved and lost
 But now I feel lost and I don't wanna live
 Say something, say that you forgive me
 Tell me that you believe me
 Have faith that we can make it, I know that it won't be easy
 But we could find a way back into that passion
 Feel the word love and get lost in the meaning
 Put you before me, your wants and your needs
 My dreams include every bit of you
 I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true
 All you gotta do is tell me that you love me too
 Say something

 Come the pastures we call grace
 A mighty river flowing upwards
 From a deep but empty grave

 And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
 You're the summit where my feet are
 Yes you are

 No less faithful when the night leads me astray

 On a train bound for nowhere
 I met up with The Gambler
 We were both too tired to sleep
 So we took turns a starin'
 Through the window at the darkness
 'Til boredom overtook us
 And he commenced to speak
 
 He said, 'Son, I've made a life
 Out of readin' people's faces
 And knowin' what their cards were
 By the way they held their eyes
 And if you don't mind my sayin'
 I would say you're out of aces
 And for one taste of your whiskey
 I will give you some advice'
 
 So I handed him my bottle
 And he drank down my last swallow
 Then he bummed a cigarette
 Then he bummed a light
 The night got deathly quiet
 And his face lost all expression
 He said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy
 You better learn to play it right'
 
 'Cause ev'ry gambler knows
 That the secret to survival
 Is knowin' what to throw away
 And knowin' what to keep
 And ev'ry hand's a winner
 Just like ev'ry hand's a loser
 And the best that you can hope for
 Is to die in your sleep.

 When the dealin' is done
 
 And when he finished speakin'
 He turned back t'ward the window
 Put out his cigarette
 Faded off to sleep
 And somewhere in the darkness
 The gambler he broke even
 But in his final words
 I found an ace that I could keep

 It was February 14 Valentine's Day
 The roses came but they took you away
 Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
 Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
 And I'll never get to show you these songs
 Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
 I see you standing there next to Mom
 Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
 Now there are days when I'm losing my faith
 Because the man wasn't good he was great
 He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
 And explain I was young, he would say,
 ""Take that rage, put it on a page.
 Take the page to the stage.
 Blow the roof off the place.""
 I'm trying to make you proud
 Do everything you did
 I hope you're up there with God saying, ""That's my kid!""

 Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
 Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
 Put your hand on a heart that was cold
 As the day you were taken away?
 I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
 Right now, I wish I could hear you say
 I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
 But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
 You used to say I won't know a win until it cost me
 Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it

Is it love?
Maybe one day

I'll give you what you like
I'll give you one last chance to hold me
If you give me one last cigarette
By now it's only in the morning
Now that I gave you what you want
All I want is to forget
When you turn off the lights
I get stars in my eyes
Is this love?

In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again
Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
That I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now
And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way (Come on)
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out
'Cause once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now
Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now, oh
So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now

And I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together
And watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath
I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me
And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
But somehow
You love me as You find me
Who am I
To think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord
Take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious
And I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing
And still You want my heart

Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not

However so slight,
Whenever it's real,
Whenever it's right.
I've been thinking long and hard
About the things you said to me,
Like a bitter stranger,
And now I see the long,
The short, the middle and what's inbetween,
I could spit on a stranger,
(Pour/pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger.
(Pour me out)
Whatever you feel,
Whatever it takes,
Whenever it's real,
Whatever awaits me,
Whatever you need,
However so slight,
Whenever it leads,
Whenever it's right.
Honey I'm a prize and you're a catch
And we're a perfect match,
Like two bitter strangers,
And now I see the long,
The short of it and I can make it last,
I could spit on a stranger,
(Pour me out)
You're a bitter stranger,
(Pour me out)
I could spit on a stranger,
(Pour me out)
You're a bitter stranger.
(Pour me out)
I see the sunshine in your eyes,
I'll try the things you'll never try,
I'll be the one that leaves
You high...high...high",Positive,Sad,10,Med

 Who has not repaid his debt
 I've been searching for a trail to follow again
 Take me back to the night we met
 
 And then I can tell myself
 What the hell I'm supposed to do
 And then I can tell myself
 Not to ride along with you
 
 I had all and then most of you
 Some and now none of you
 Take me back to the night we met
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do
 Haunted by the ghost of you
 Take me back to the night we met
 
 When the night was full of terrors
 And your eyes were filled with tears
 When you had not touched me yet
 Oh, take me back to the night we met
 
 I had all and then most of you
 Some and now none of you
 Take me back to the night we met
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do
 Haunted by the ghost of you
 Take me back to the night we met",Positive,Sad,10,Med

On my perilous heart
To befriend me to my bitter end
And carry the burden
For as graven my failure
You prevailed in pure love
To be found in the depths of Your heart
As good as forgiven
O how You graced that cross
Where Jesus died and death took the loss
Wild as the floodgates of heaven
Flung wide open within His scars
Now mine is the life You raised
Yours the glory that took down that grave
Bright as the sun almighty in love
God forever Your Kingdom come
O how sweet is the sound
Of a heart drenched in grace
Rising up from the ashes in praise
Alive to Your greatness
Hope as brazen as mercy
Through the terrible night
How You blaze through the darkness I fight
Bright as the morning
O how You graced that cross
Where Jesus died and death took the loss
Wild as the floodgates of heaven
Flung wide open within His scars
Now mine is the life You raised
Yours the glory that took down that grave
Bright as the sun almighty in love
God forever Your Kingdom come
My heart burns wild in my chest
In awe of Your heart in all that You are
Let Your praise run wild on my breath
In awe of Your heart I'll sing it again

The great unknown where feet may fail
